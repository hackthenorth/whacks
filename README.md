WHacks 2014 Website
===================

The WHacks 2014 website.

That's about it really. Nothing very exciting.

On a mac, to run the site on a local server, open terminal in the same directory as index.html and type
 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view the site.
